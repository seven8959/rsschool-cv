		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<p>I found out about such profession as Front end developer in December, 2019 I got interested in this speciality.</p>
		<p>I have always been interested in working with computers, but I had never gone into details before 2019. Some spare time appeared in summer and I started to study. I began with reading the professional literature, trying to make layouts, watching educational videos. But I understood that the themes were becoming harder and it was better to take a class.</p>
		<p>During some time I was looking for appropriate online courses. I considered only online courses as I live in a little town and I don’t have offline IT courses here. Eventually, I chose UKRAINIAN IT_SCHOOL. It was awesome. I learned a lot of useful and interesting information and attended lessons with great pleasure. After Front end courses at UKRAINIAN IT_SCHOOL I decided that I also need to gain knowledge in JavaScript. And immediately enrolled in the course at Hillel school. I got a certificate with a “very good” mark.</p>
		<p>It is really fascinating, when you get a great result made of code. I consider it as an art. I am not going to stop and I plan to study further, to develop my skills and reach my goals.</p>
